              As a relationship coach and emotional intelligence expert, I begin by creating a space where you feel seen and deeply understood — often for the first time in your life.

            <p style="font-size: 0.94rem; color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 0.7rem;">
              Through genuine connection and heartfelt presence, trust naturally blossoms. In that safety, your heart opens, your walls soften, and you become receptive to real healing.

              From this place of emotional honesty, I gently guide you to reclaim your worth, rewrite your patterns, and step into relationships and a life where you feel loved, valued and fulfilling.

            <p style="font-size: 0.94rem; color: var(--text-muted);">
              Emotionally, we help you heal from past wounds, toxic dynamics or low self-worth.
              Psychologically, we help you move beyond fear, doubt and limiting beliefs into grounded confidence and self-leadership.

                  We map what's really happening across your health, money, relationships and purpose — emotionally, mentally and practically.

                  <span class="step-label">Step 02 · Understand the Root Patterns</span>
                  We identify deep subconscious patterns, old experiences and protective strategies that created your current reality.

                <li>
                  <span class="step-label">Step 03 · Release & Heal</span>
                  Using Emotional Intelligence, NLP and Applied Spirituality, we gently soften and release the patterns that keep you looping in the same stories.

                <li>
                  <span class="step-label">Step 04 · Rewire with New Patterns & Gentle Practices</span>
                  Together we design small, self-chosen practices, reflections and experiments that match who you're becoming — not who you've been.
                  These are not "homework" to impress anyone:
                  they are your own self-agreements, chosen by you, for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="step-label">Step 05 · Rise & Ripple Outward</span>
                  As your inner world clears and strengthens, you notice shifts in your body, money, relationships and sense of purpose.
                  You become the person through whom "When one transforms, the whole world shifts a little higher" starts feeling true.

            <p class="about-tag">
              I'm Maanviya — founder of InnerGymX, Emotional Intelligence Expert and specialised Relationship Coach.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Before I held space for others, I was simply a human being trying to hold space for myself.
              I know what it feels like to be high on potential but low on clarity, strong on the outside but quietly exhausted inside,
              surrounded by people yet still feeling alone with your thoughts.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              My life has been an ongoing experiment in <strong>Inner Renaissance through education</strong> —
              unlearning old beliefs, learning a new way of being, and then passing that wisdom forward.
              InnerGymX was born from one understanding: <strong>when one human transforms, the world around them shifts a little higher.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="about-highlight">
              I'm not here as a perfect guru. I'm here as someone who also had to untangle patterns, heal from hurt and slowly choose a life that actually fits her soul.
              That's why I don't sit above you — I walk beside you.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Along the way, I trained as an Emotional Intelligence expert and a specialised Relationship Coach,
              so I could turn my lived experience into precise tools that truly help.
              Every session we share is a mix of heart, skill and structure — rooted in NLP, Emotional Intelligence, Applied Spirituality and the Law of Attraction, customised to your season of life.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              If you've been waiting for a sign that it's time to unclutter your life and step into who you're meant to be — consider this your gentle nudge. Let's walk this chapter together.
