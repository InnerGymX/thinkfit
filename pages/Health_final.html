              <h3 class="insight-heading">What might really be going on underneath your symptoms</h3>
              <p class="insight-body">
                Under the recurring pain, fatigue or anxiety, there may be:
              </p>
              <ul class="insight-list">
                <li>A nervous system stuck in survival mode (fight, flight or freeze).</li>
                <li>Unprocessed stress, grief, pressure or emotional load held in the body.</li>
                <li>Beliefs like "I must always push harder" or "rest is laziness" driving burnout.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="insight-body" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
                At InnerGymX, we see your health as an ecosystem. We don't blame your mind, and we don't fight your body. We help both come back to the same team.

            <p class="section-subtitle">

              <ul class="insight-list">
                <li>**The Vagus Nerve:** The highway between your brain and your gut/heart.</li>

                <li>**Cortisol Levels:** Pushing a stressed body harder actually reduces progress.</li>
